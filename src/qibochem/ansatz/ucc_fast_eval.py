"""
Fast statevector evolution for UCC Pauli rotations.
Fast eval uses the qubit operators directly to evolve the given state rather than build 
the full circuit every time. This is mathematically equivalent, but faster. 
Caveat is that UCC circuit is still needed if you want to simulate actual hardware noise etc
because that will account for the gates. But for simple simulation of VQE with many repeated 
evaluations of the UCC circuit, fast eval is generally recommended
